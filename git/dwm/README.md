# Luke's build of dwm

## Patches and features

- New layouts: bstack, fibonacci, deck, centered master and more. All bound to keys `super+(shift+)t/y/u/i`.
- True fullscreen (`super+f`) and prevents focus shifting.
- [vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/): Gaps allowed across all layouts.
- [swallow patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/): if a program run from a terminal would make it inoperable, it temporarily takes its place to save space.


## Installation for newbs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

There is also a `PKGBUILD` usable on distributions with pacman but it doesn't like me sourcing themes, I am more than certain you could program it to include a theme and stuff but that would be a huge pain the ass and why would you even do that

### You must also install `libxft-bgra`!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/), which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
